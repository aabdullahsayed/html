        <p>Bangladesh is reeling from a wave of unrest over quotas for government jobs, with the number of casualties still being tallied. The government puts the official death toll at 150, but according to the Bangladeshi media, at least 210 people, mostly young, lost their lives. Thousands more were injured. As the protests escalated across the country, internet and mobile networks were shut down to prevent communication among the demonstrators. The government deployed the police, the military and the border guard paramilitaries to quell the unrest. Additionally, some protesters reported being attacked by the members of the Chhatra League, the student wing of the ruling party, Awami League. Some restrictions have since been eased, although social media platforms and educational institutions remain closed.</p>
